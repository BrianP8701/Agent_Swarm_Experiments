We want functions that can:
    Take text describing a function
    Return a function

In addition we need the option to:
    Generate test cases for the function
    Make the function executable
    Run the function with the test cases
    Save the function
save the function, test the function

We want an agent that can:
    Take a function and a set of arguments
    Return the result of the function

## Agents


## Functions Config
json file with:
    function name
    function description
    function arguments
    function return type
    function test cases
    function code
    function dependencies

### Who can call functions?
there is one global entrypoint to functions: exec_function()
It checks if the 

### Initial Functions:
- create_assistant()
- create_function() 
- create_test_cases()
- test_function()
- save_function()



All of the above initialization will happen in what is called a 'toolkit'



okay fuck scrap the toolkit.

## Swarm flow in my head 1
Create head agent
Pass goal to head agent through chat()
Take output of chat(). Spawn a new standard agent with the output of chat() as the instructions

In order to write functions that interact with other functions, an agent needs to:
    1. be aware of the other functions
    2. be able to call the other functions

To be aware of other functions we need to include in the context all the function names, descriptions and parameters

There are some flows that are concrete, like the one aforementioned. But how can the swarm autonomously create and access new flows?
