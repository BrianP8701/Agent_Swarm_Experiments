# Agent_Swarm_Experiments
Making experiments locally to contribute to AGI. Documenting my journey on YouTube @ [AI Agent Swarm Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO8gVow6df_Rh7DEJ10_WAdnkGnIRCh-K&si=eYdyBu7NShKckilS)


**ATTENTION**
TLDR: Everything is in the tool_building folder. I have no readable documentation yet ik
This README is not being used rn. THIS PROJECT IS ACTIVE. Im just working on the 'tool_building' experiment, which has actually evolved to be a much bigger experiment than i initially planned. Im going to carry on with lots of swarm development there until I achieve a point where the swarm can effectively write code for itself and execute it, along with the basic tools like web browsing etc. then i will begin a new experiment and update this. 


# Principles
    1. Make everything as simple as possible
    2. Make swarm universally applicable/infinitely scalable to any goal
    3. Strategically build to take advantage of SOTA models
    4. Prepare for new modalities and robotics

## Usage
First, configure the .env file. Each subfolder contains an idea or experiment (RAG/agent swarm related). Each experiment contains a plan.md file for my personal use (likely not of any use to you), and a docs.md which you should read. The docs.md will contain usage instructions, architecture details etc.

In the rest of this file I will describe the motivation and takeaways of each experiment.

## Experiments

In theory - or my imagination at least - there ought to be an inflection point where the swarm becomes self sufficient. 

The swarm needs to be self aware that it is a swarm. The top agents need to know about the system they operate in. They need sufficient context. Lower agents who gain more and more specific tasks will need less context.



### Tool Building Experiment
Make the swarm capable of writing code for its own use and modifying itself
