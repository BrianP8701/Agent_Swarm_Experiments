# Agent_Swarm_Experiments
Making experiments locally to contribute to https://github.com/daveshap/OpenAI_Agent_Swarm

## Usage
This project isn't meant to be run from the root. Rather each folder contains an idea or specific experiment that is to be run from that folder. The shared folder contains tools and functions I figure I'll use often for agent/RAG related stuff.
